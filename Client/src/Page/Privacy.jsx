          Such communications may involve giving to you, as well as receiving
          information from you. We collect and receive the Personal Information
          in the following ways:

          while using our Platform including when you enter your Personal
          Information into data fields on the Platform as part of a voluntary
          registration process. We also collect and store your Personal
          Information through sponsored social media platforms, events, etc. For

          features of the Platform may not work without use of passive
          information collection technologies. Information collected by these
          technologies cannot be used to identity you without additional
          identifiable information. We may also receive/store information about
          your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier
          for your device.
